Multiply the result by 12: 8 * 12 = 96.\\n\\nAnswer: 96', additional_kwargs={'reasoning_content': \"Okay, so I've got this math problem here: (3 + 5) * 12. Hmm, let me break it down step by step. First, I remember that in math problems, especially when there are parentheses, I should do what's inside them first. So, 3 plus 5. That's straightforward, right? 3 plus 5 equals 8. So now, the problem simplifies to 8 multiplied by 12.\\n\\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure if I should handle the addition first. Maybe I should double-check the order of operations. I think it's parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and then addition and subtraction, often remembered by PEMDAS. So yes, the addition inside the parentheses comes first. That part seems right.\\n\\nNow, moving on to the multiplication: 8 times 12. I'm a bit rusty on my multiplication tables, so let me think. 8 times 10 is 80, and 8 times 2 is 16. So if I add those together, 80 plus 16 equals 96. So, 8 multiplied by 12 should be 96.\\n\\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I should try another way to confirm. Let's see, 12 times 8. I know that 12 times 10 is 120, and 12 times (-2) is -24. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 8 is positive. Maybe I should think of it as 12 times 8, which is the same as 8 times 12. Yeah, that's commutative property. So, 12 times 8 is also 96. That matches what I had before, so I must be right.\\n\\nAlternatively, I could add 12 eight times: 12 + 12 is 24, plus another 12 is 36, then 48, 60, 72, 84, and finally 96. That's adding 12 eight times, which also gives me 96. So, three different methods all pointing to the same answer. That makes me confident that 8 times 12 is indeed 96.\\n\\nSo putting it all together, (3 + 5) is 8, and 8 times 12 is 96. Therefore, the final answer should be 96. I think that's it.

Multiply the result by 12: 8 * 12 = 96.\\n3. Add 2 to the product: 96 + 2 = 98.\\n\\nFinal Answer: 98', additional_kwargs={'reasoning_content': \"Okay, so I have this math problem to solve: ((3 + 5) * 12) + 2. Hmm, let me break it down step by step. First, I remember that in math problems, I should follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction. So, looking at the problem, the innermost part is the parentheses: (3 + 5). That seems straightforward. 3 plus 5 is 8. \\n\\nNow, after solving the parentheses, the problem becomes (8 * 12) + 2. Next up is the multiplication part. So, 8 multiplied by 12. Let me do that calculation. 8 times 12... I can think of 8 times 10 is 80, and 8 times 2 is 16, so adding those together gives me 96. So now the problem simplifies to 96 + 2.\\n\\nFinally, I just need to add 96 and 2 together. That's easy, it equals 98. So the final result should be 98. I think that's correct, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting over, (3 + 5) is 8, multiplied by 12 gives 96, and adding 2 gives 98. Yep, that seems right.

This can be understood through various methods such as repeated addition, distributive property, real-world examples, and binary multiplication, all consistently leading to the same result.\\n\\n**Answer:** 10', additional_kwargs={'reasoning_content': 'Alright, so I need to figure out what 2 multiplied by 5 is. Hmm, that seems pretty straightforward, but let me think about it step by step to make sure I understand it correctly.\\n\\nFirst off, multiplication is essentially repeated addition. So, when I see 2 * 5, I can think of it as adding 2 together 5 times. Let me write that out:\\n\\n2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s add them up one by one:\\n\\n- Start with the first 2.\\n- Add another 2: 2 + 2 = 4.\\n- Add another 2: 4 + 2 = 6.\\n- Add another 2: 6 + 2 = 8.\\n- Add the last 2: 8 + 2 = 10.\\n\\nSo, 2 multiplied by 5 equals 10.\\n\\nAlternatively, I could reverse the numbers to check if multiplication is commutative. That means 5 * 2 should also give me 10. Let me confirm that:\\n\\n5 * 2 = 10.\\n\\nYep, that checks out.\\n\\nI guess another way to think about it is using the distributive property. For example, I can break down the numbers to make the multiplication easier. Let\\'s say I break 5 into 2 + 3:\\n\\n2 * (2 + 3) = (2 * 2) + (2 * 3) = 4 + 6 = 10.\\n\\nThat still gives me the same result.\\n\\nI could also use visual aids to help me understand. Imagine I have two groups of five apples. Each group has five apples, so:\\n\\nGroup 1: Apple, Apple, Apple, Apple, Apple.\\nGroup 2: Apple, Apple, Apple, Apple, Apple.\\n\\nIf I count all the apples together, that\\'s 10 apples in total.\\n\\nAnother method is using the concept of arrays. If I arrange objects in rows and columns, the total number of objects is the product of the number of rows and columns. So, if I have 2 rows of 5 objects each:\\n\\nRow 1: ● ● ● ● ●\\nRow 2: ● ● ● ● ●\\n\\nCounting all the objects gives me 10.\\n\\nI could also use skip counting. Starting from zero, I count by fives twice:\\n\\n5, 10.\\n\\nThat\\'s two fives, which is 10.\\n\\nTo ensure I\\'m not making a mistake, I\\'ll use a calculator or a multiplication chart. Let me visualize a multiplication chart:\\n\\n```\\n   | 1  2  3  4  5\\n-------------------\\n 1 | 1  2  3  4  5\\n 2 | 2  4  6  8 10\\n 3 | 3  6  9 12 15\\n 4 | 4  8 12 16 20\\n 5 | 5 10 15 20 25\\n```\\n\\nLooking at the second row (for 2) and the fifth column (for 5), the intersection is 10.\\n\\nI can also think about real-world examples. For instance, if I have two bags with five marbles each, how many marbles do I have in total? That\\'s 2 * 5 = 10 marbles.\\n\\nAnother way is to use the formula for multiplication:\\n\\n\\\\[ 2 \\\\times 5 = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{5} 2 \\\\]\\n\\nThis means adding 2 five times, which we\\'ve already established equals 10.\\n\\nI could also use exponents, but that might be more complicated for such small numbers. However, just to explore:\\n\\n\\\\[ 2 \\\\times 5 = 2^{\\\\log_2(5)} \\\\]\\n\\nBut this seems unnecessary for such a simple multiplication.\\n\\nTo further verify, I\\'ll use the inverse operation. Division. If 2 * 5 = 10, then dividing 10 by 2 should give me 5, and dividing 10 by 5 should give me 2. Let\\'s check:\\n\\n10 ÷ 2 = 5\\n\\n10 ÷ 5 = 2\\n\\nBoth are correct, which supports that 2 * 5 = 10.\\n\\nAdditionally, thinking about money, if I have two $5 bills, how much money do I have? That\\'s 2 * 5 = $10.\\n\\nI could also use mental math tricks. For example, multiplying by 2 is the same as adding the number to itself:\\n\\n5 + 5 = 10.\\n\\nSo, 2 * 5 = 10.\\n\\nAnother perspective is using the number line. Starting at 0, if I make two jumps of 5 units each:\\n\\n- First jump: 0 + 5 = 5\\n- Second jump: 5 + 5 = 10\\n\\nSo, landing on 10 after two jumps of 5.\\n\\nI might also consider binary representations to understand it computationally. The number 2 in binary is 10, and 5 is 101. Multiplying them in binary:\\n\\n```\\n    10\\n  x 101\\n  ----\\n    10  (this is 2 in decimal)\\n   000  (this is 0 shifted left by one)\\n 10100  (this is 101 shifted left by two)\\n  ----\\n 10100  (which is 20 in decimal)\\n```\\n\\nWait, that gives me 20, which is incorrect. I must have made a mistake here. Let me correct that.\\n\\nActually, multiplying 2 (10 in binary) by 5 (101 in binary) should give me 10 in decimal, which is 1010 in binary. Let me try the multiplication again properly.\\n\\n```\\n     10\\n   x 101\\n   ----\\n     10  (2)\\n   000   (shifted left by one)\\n 1010    (shifted left by two)\\n  ----\\n 1010  (10 in decimal)\\n```\\n\\nAh, that\\'s correct. So, 2 * 5 in binary is indeed 1010, which is 10 in decimal.\\n\\nAnother approach is using algebra. Let me set up an equation:\\n\\nLet x = 2 * 5.\\n\\nTo find x, I can divide both sides by 2:\\n\\nx / 2 = 5\\n\\nThen, multiply both sides by 2:\\n\\nx = 5 * 2\\n\\nWhich again gives x = 10.\\n\\nI could also think about fractions. If I have 2 wholes, each whole divided into 5 parts, how many parts do I have? That would be 2 * 5 = 10 parts.\\n\\nIn terms of geometry, if I have a rectangle with a length of 5 units and a width of 2 units, the area (which is length multiplied by width) would be 10 square units.\\n\\nConsidering the properties of numbers, multiplication is associative and commutative. So, (2 * 5) is the same as (5 * 2), and both equal 10.\\n\\nI could also use the concept of repeated addition with different groupings. For example, adding 2 five times or adding 5 two times both result in 10.\\n\\nAdditionally, thinking about the multiplication table, as I mentioned earlier, helps reinforce that 2 * 5 = 10.\\n\\nI might also use real-life scenarios to solidify my understanding. For example, if I have two dogs, and each dog has five bones, how many bones are there in total? That\\'s 2 * 5 = 10 bones.\\n\\nAnother way is to use the distributive property with different numbers. For instance, 2 * (1 + 4) = (2 * 1) + (2 * 4) = 2 + 8 = 10.\\n\\nI could also use algebraic expressions. Let me set up an expression where 2 * 5 is part of a larger equation. For example:\\n\\nIf 2 * x = 10, then x = 10 / 2 = 5.\\n\\nThis shows that 2 * 5 = 10.\\n\\nFurthermore, using the concept of inverse operations, if I know that division is the inverse of multiplication, then dividing 10 by 2 gives me 5, which confirms that 2 * 5 = 10.\\n\\nI could also use number bonds. Knowing that 5 is composed of 2 and 3, I can think of 2 * 5 as 2 * (2 + 3) = 4 + 6 = 10.\\n\\nAnother method is using the area model. If I create a rectangle where one side is 2 and the other is 5, the area of the rectangle represents the product, which is 10.\\n\\nAdditionally, thinking about money again, if I have five $2 bills, how much do I have? That\\'s 5 * 2 = $10.\\n\\nI could also use exponents creatively. Knowing that 5 is 5^1 and 2 is 2^1, but that doesn\\'t directly help here. However, using exponent rules, 2^1 * 5^1 = 10^1 = 10.\\n\\nAnother perspective is through the lens of set theory. If I have two sets, one with five elements and another with two elements, the Cartesian product\\'s cardinality is 2 * 5 = 10.\\n\\nI might also consider the English words. \"Two fives\" are ten. In time, five minutes twice is ten minutes.\\n\\nIn summary, through various methods—repeated addition, distributive property, real-world examples, binary multiplication, algebra, geometry, and more—it consistently shows that 2 multiplied by 5 equals 10. This redundancy across different mathematical concepts reinforces the correctness of the answer.\\n'}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 2102, 'prompt_tokens': 431, 'total_tokens': 2533, 'completion_time': 7.643636364, 'prompt_time': 0.027650556, 'queue_time': 0.202421972, 'total_time': 7.67128692}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_1bbe7845ec', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--1e9dd3a5-8f36-412a-85cb-2df468c9c07a-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 431, 'output_tokens': 2102, 'total_tokens': 2533})]}})\n",
